        <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
        <p>I am very much interested in sports. Some of the sports
            I play are football,cricket,Badminton,Table Tennis and 100m,200m
            running.
        </p>
        <p>The game I am best at is football. I have been part of my school team from 3rd 
            till my 10th grade. I prefer to play as a striker but I have
            played at every position for my school team even as a Goalkeeper for a year.
